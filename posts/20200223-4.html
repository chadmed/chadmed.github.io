        <p>
            <a href="20200223-6.html">Part 6</a> hammers home the fact that all of this
            is a result of shameless and disgusting short sighted political manoeuvring
            by the Liberal Party to protect the interests of Rupert Murdoch and other
            corporate friends such as Telstra.

        <h1>An NBN retrospective - Part 4.</h1>
        <p>
            It’s no great secret that the LTE component of the rollout has been
            spectacularly mismanaged. Utilising LTE to get high speed broadband
            access to properties too costly and too remote for wireline technologies was
            a good idea, however as with all things of this nature, cost cutting has led
            to a service so broken and so unreliable that many within its footprint elect
            to retain their ADSL services. Since switching to Fixed Wireless NBN, Whirlpool
            user Greg Lehey has experienced no less than 288 hours of downtime. Stories like
            this have emerged all over the country, with people reporting their services
            simply become unavailable during peak times. This is mostly due to bandwidth
            constrains imposed by the ineherent design of the NBN LTE network.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the biggest oversights in relation to the LTE network is the lack of
            backhaul capacity from each tower to its respective POI. As LTE is a shared
            medium, multiple users must share a single link back to the NBN Point of Interconnect,
            or POI. This is a colocation facility, where user traffic is handed off to the
            various ISPs’ networks. In order to cut costs, NBNCo elected to underprovision the
            amount of backhaul from each tower to the POI. Normally, it would be pretty trivial
            to increase backhaul capacity, as it would simply be a matter of increasing the
            bandwidth of the fibre optic link to the tower. However, NBNCo’s cost cutting
            method is so spectacularly stupid that this is simply not a possibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead of running a fibre optic cable to each tower for backhaul capacity,
            NBNCo has elected to use a wireless microwave link for many towers in a hub
            and spoke model. A microwave link is established between the POI and a master
            tower, which then divides the bandwidth of that link between multiple slave towers,
            which then connect actual end users to the network. This makes it incredibly
            hard to upgrade backhaul capacity to each tower, as it involves replacing expensive
            antennas or increasing the wireless bandwidth used, which often (always) isn’t
            possible due to extremely limited wireless spectrum available, and legally
            mandated power limits on wireless transmitters.
        </p>

        <p>
            While NBNCo have claimed that there exists a list of towers and backhaul
            sites that require upgrading, there is little to no evidence that they have
            actually undertaken any such work. People are simply being left with the choice
            of either braving the peak hour congestion, or retaining their ADSL services
            and thus being forced to spend more than they need to. Regional areas within
            the LTE footprint are historically underserviced with DSL too, often only being
            able to get a connection from Telstra.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two solutions for remediating the LTE network. Obviously, the most
            pressing matter is getting sufficient backhaul to each tower in order to alleviate
            the peak hour congestion and inherent unreliability that comes with using a
            cascaded microwave link. The only way to do this is to run fibre optic backhaul
            to each tower. This is an absolute necessity if NBNCo ever hope to make Fixed Wireless
            a viable solution for regional broadband access, and should have been the only backhaul
            method specified in the Network Design Rules. Not only will it remove the weakest
            link in the network in terms of bandwidth capacity, it will also allow NBNCo to
            free up the wireless spectrum they currently use on backhaul and reallocate it
            to increasing bandwidth on the consumer side of the network.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another pressing matter for the LTE rollout is tower oversubscription. Much
            like with HFC, there are simply too many end users competing for bandwidth
            from a single tower. Of course, with multiple towers sharing a microwave
            link back to the POI, this is simply a cascade effect of underprovisioning
            of backhaul capacity. However, assuming we have now supplied each tower
            with its own fibre optic link, we can address this issue by splitting
            down towers, again much in the same way an HFC node split works.
        </p>

        <p>
            Assuming a 1:2 split, this would mean an effective doubling of available
            bandwidth for each end user between their premises and the tower. This
            increased bandwidth availability then allows NBNCo to offer faster plans
            across the network, making the same plans available across both wireline
            and fixed wireless technologies
        </p>

        <p>
            Another minor consideration to make is the rising adoption of 5G, and the
            improvements it brings over LTE. At this stage, such an upgrade would
            be purely optional, and made in consideration of private competition.
            The expense necessary to cover regional Australia with 5G for either
            NBNCo or a private competitor would be ruinous, and so we will not consider
            this other than to remark that it is a possible (and likely) upgrade path
            in the medium to long term. With the bandwidth increases we have made above,
            LTE is still perfectly capable of delivering high speed broadband for
            some time to come, and any 5G upgrade would either be purely marketing
            or for increasing bandwidth efficiency to enable a greater number of
            customers to connect to the same tower.
